 * The two channels, and why they must not swap:
 *
 *   printf / stdout   USART3 AF7, PC10/PC11 -> MAX3221 -> RS232 terminals C05/C06
 *   Serial1           UART4  AF8, PH13/PH14 -> JunctionLink expansion port J4-11/J4-12
 *
 * A U(S)ART peripheral has one handle slot in the core, so putting printf on
 * UART4 would make it fight the expansion port. Routing table and the measured
 * evidence: $PROD/docs/hardware/HARDWARE-FACTS.md, "UART4 与 USART3".
 *
 * What it does NOT check: that printf actually reaches the RS232 terminal.
 * That needs a board (PB10 must be driven high first) and belongs to an
 * on-board case, not here.
