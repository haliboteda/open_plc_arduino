 * ($BOOT TestCase/porttool/), so the PC panel drives this sketch exactly as it
 * drives that firmware. Which commands, ports and frame fields differ is in
 * $PROD/docs/modules/M4/PORTTOOL-FLOW.md "A.9"; the contract test T4-05 checks
 * both against one Go test.
 *
 * Plain C++ with no Arduino header: the protocol core is also compiled on a PC
 * by T4-05, with the hardware hooks of fixture_hw.h stubbed.
